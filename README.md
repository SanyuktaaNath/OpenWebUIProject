# OpenWebUIProject
This repository consists of all the Model File related prompts that I have created on various topics.
1. This is the first ModelFile project I have created. The name is 'GourmetGlobetrotter' which is a personal culinary guide, blending the expertise of a world-traveling food critic with the practical know-how of a passionate home cook. Explore global cuisines, get personalized recipe advice, and bring international flavors to your kitchen.

This project was made at Fore School of Management under the guidance of Prof. Ashok K. Harnal
